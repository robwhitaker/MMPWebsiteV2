  summaryBlurb: 
    headline: is a lighthearted serial novel, a blood-soaked murder-fest, a story that believes that horror can be fun. It\'s a party, and you\'re invited!
    description: "You hold in your hands an invitation to the Midnight Murder Party, the paper trimmed with gold and the words handwritten in looping cursive by the hostess herself. The letter invites you to a mansion where the rules of life and death no longer apply. Resurrection is the norm; killing each other is a game; and being dismembered over the last cookie is to be expected. The rules of the night\\'s game are simple: if you get killed, you have to tell the group a story.\\n\\nThe hostess of the Party, Arlene, eagerly awaits your response. What do you say, Reader?"
