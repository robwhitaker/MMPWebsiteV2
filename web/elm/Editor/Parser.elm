As soon as it&rsquo;s down, she jerks forward, choking on the stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-what the heck&rsquo;s in this, Arlene?&rdquo; she sputters between violent coughs. &ldquo;It tastes gross!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It does taste kinda funny,&rdquo; Aidan says, taking another sip out of his own cup as if to make up for being impolite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As it should,&rdquo; Arlene agrees, her eyes bright. &ldquo;That tea you all drank is the beginning of our next game.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You put something in it, didn&rsquo;t ya Arly?&rdquo; Marc </span><span class="c1">suggests</span><span class="c1">, still reclined in his chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I had April add a secret ingredient to that tea. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be feeling its effects soon enough. However, I&rsquo;ve hidden a silver flask with the antidote somewhere in this mansion. There is only enough for one person, so needless to say, if you have any intention of finding it, you won&rsquo;t want to dawdle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna find it first!&rdquo; Marissa shouts, jumping out of her chair and running for the archway by the grandfather clock. Aidan looks first at Marissa and then expectantly at his brother who nods that he should catch up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t leave me behind!&rdquo; Aidan calls, running out of the room after her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they are both out of sight, Arlene turns to Marc. &ldquo;Jeez, they didn&rsquo;t even wait for my clue,&rdquo; she says, pouting. &ldquo;Are you not going with them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marc lifts up his cup of tea and swishes it around, grinning. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d fall for something that simple, did you? Then again, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d pull something so simple anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s early and this is your brother&rsquo;s first party. Thought I&rsquo;d give him a freebie. Plus...&rdquo; She moves closer to Marc and whispers something in his ear, cupping her hand around her mouth so that you cannot make out what she says. When she moves back, Marc looks up at her and nods. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.kcc6cgxbqqk6"></a><span class="c6">2</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait up!&rdquo; Aidan yells across the foyer, panting. Marissa stops before the wide </span><span class="c1">breadth</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of the staircase and spins around on her heels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; where are we going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa snorts.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c7">We</span><span class="c1">? Well, </span><span class="c1 c7">I </span><span class="c1">am gonna find the antidote. </span><span class="c1 c7">You</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can just sit on the steps and wait for the poison to kick in or whatever.&rdquo; She looks around the wide foyer and then back at Aidan. &ldquo;What are you still staring at me for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Aidan says, &ldquo;I was thinking that, maybe, we could look&hellip; together?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No way! If you wanna look for it so bad, go search on your own.&rdquo; Marissa begins to turn around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&hellip; uh&hellip; where do I look?&rdquo; Aidan asks, alarmed. He winces as if expecting a blow from Marissa when she turns to face him again. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I dunno, go wander around. I call the sitting room! Arlene hides, like, everything in there.&rdquo; She turns and runs across the foyer and under another arch across from the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;grand hall</span><span class="c1">. Almost as soon as she disappears into the next room, a loud crash followed by shattering glass rings out. Aidan blinks twice, staring blankly at the arch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; Are you o&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Marissa shouts from the sitting room. &ldquo;Your trap missed, Arlene! I&rsquo;m getting too good at this! Wait&hellip; oh sh&mdash;&rdquo; Another window seems to shatter in the next room.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan stares towards the the sound for a moment longer before shrugging and turning into one of the doors beside the staircase. It opens into a long, T-shaped hallway that stretches across the width of the house behind the stairs and the grand hall, ending on one side with a door to the sitting room and on the other with a window that lets pale moonlight into the hall. In the center, it branches off and extends deeper into the house. Aidan looks left towards the sitting room door and then right towards the window, frowning. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a very fun game,&rdquo; he mutters before wandering down the center hall and farther into the mansion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The floor here is carpeted down the middle with beautiful red and gold patterns, and along the sides of the hall where the carpet ends, the floor is a dark, polished brown. Aidan&rsquo;s eyes catch something stretched over the wood&mdash;a thin, silver line like a spiderweb pulled </span><span class="c1">taut</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;across the hallway&mdash;and he bends down to look at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes narrow with mistrustful intrigue as he studies the sliver of wire, and after a quick inspection of the walls around him, he reaches out, warily pokes it, and snatches his hand back with a gasp. Nothing happens. He releases his breath in a slow sigh, stands up again, and steps carefully over the wire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he continues down the hall, he glances repeatedly at the ground in front of him, but doesn&rsquo;t find anything else that looks suspicious. On his right, he comes across an unlabeled door and stops at it, raising his fist, lowering it, raising it again, and then finally tapping lightly. He waits a minute with no response before tapping on it one more time. After another couple seconds, he reaches out and slowly pushes it open, as if expecting someone to </span><span class="c1">yell not to come in</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at the last moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But no one calls out, and he finds himself in what appears to be a small theater. Against the wall to his right, a large screen is spread facing multiple rows of graduated seats. He sidles up to the first row, his eyes still flicking down to the floor every couple seconds, and peers under the seats. &ldquo;Mr. Flask,&rdquo; he whispers, &ldquo;Oh Mr. Flask, are you down here?&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Standing up again, he looks at the seat in front of him, pulls it open, and hesitantly reaches into the crevice between the seat and the back of the chair. </span><span class="c1">His face twists uncomfortably as his hand disappears into the darkness of the gap and fishes around against the soft fabric. After a couple seconds, he pulls his hand back still empty, and a dismayed look comes across his face as he counts the rest of the seats in the room. There must be at least fifty, maybe more. He looks into the room for another moment, biting his index finger, and decides to leave and head back to find Marissa in the sitting room. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sitting room is large, but not quite as impressive as the grand hall. White couches crowd around coffee tables in the center, and off to one side, a large T.V. hangs mounted on the wall. On the other are several sad-looking shattered windows. The inside of the archway has been impaled by barbed spears that jut out across from holes on the opposite wall. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the room, Marissa is tearing through the coat check, tossing coats with out-turned pockets all over the floor. Aidan opens his mouth to say something but closes it again without making a sound. Instead, he webs his fingers together and quietly watches the girl with the pretty auburn hair toss coats around. It takes a couple minutes before Marissa notices him standing there with his bashful smile, and she spins around, scowling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to search somewhere else? I called this room already.&rdquo; Aidan tries to say something again and instead only manages a squeak of a &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; before ducking behind a couch and peering out at the girl in the black and red dress. &ldquo;And I told ya to stop staring at me,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seriously creepy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He ducks farther behind the furniture, and his hand lands on something just underneath the couch. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you keep hiding behind stuff anyway? It&rsquo;s so weird. You&rsquo;re like a stalker or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip;&rdquo; Aidan manages, pulling a small object out from under the couch. &ldquo;I found this.&rdquo; He holds up a small silver box, about the size of a flask.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? Gimme that!&rdquo; Before Aidan has time to react, Marissa closes the gap in the room and snatches the box out of his hand. &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">I toldya, didn&rsquo;t I?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Arlene hides everything in here.&rdquo; She tears the box open and stares at its contents with a puzzled expression. &ldquo;The heck is this?&rdquo; A piece of paper decorated with flourishing borders lies inside the box. Aidan peeks around Marissa to read it.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c19"><span class="c2">Hi Marissa,</span></p><p class="c0 c19"><span class="c2">I had a feeling you&rsquo;d run out without waiting for a hint about the antidote, so I hid this hint in the sitting room for you. See the attached riddle... or </span><span class="c2">just give up and die</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c14">&#9786;</span></p><p class="c0 c22"><span class="c2">Love,</span></p><p class="c3 c19"><span class="c2">Arly &hearts;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marissa flips the paper and her eyes skim over the riddle on the back. &ldquo;Oh, you have </span><span class="c1 c7">got</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to be kidding me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.6s7nz1n50oaa"></a><span class="c6">3</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc and Arlene are sitting in the tea room chatting. April has brought out new tea for both of them, and Marc takes a sip from his cup.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you poisoned this cup,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ve chosen some good poison.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arlene laughs. &ldquo;Why thank you. I only serve the most high quality cups of death to my guests.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But of course. By the way, I don&rsquo;t suppose you have an eye patch lying around? Having a hole in my head feels pretty weird.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, so you </span><span class="c1 c7">did</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;notice! Playing it up for Marissa again, huh? Here, I&rsquo;ll have April bring you an eyepatch from the costume room. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the junk I&rsquo;ve got in there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on cue, April enters the room. &ldquo;Is the tea alright?&rdquo; she asks mildly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Arlene pipes up. &ldquo;Oh and would you mind getting an eyepatch from the costume room for Marc? I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be getting his eye back anytime soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April glances at the gaping socket in Marc&rsquo;s face, attempts to hide a cringe, and exits the room. Once she is out of sight, Marc turns back to Arlene.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with her anyway? She&rsquo;s not a Figment like your regular servants. She&rsquo;s human, like us, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Indeed she is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, why do you have her working instead of moving into town or joining in on the party?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arlene leans back in her chair and sighs. &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t my first choice! She was in pretty bad shape when I found her, so I put her up in one of the guest bedrooms upstairs. But it took a couple weeks just to get her to say more than &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; when I brought her food. She didn&rsquo;t want to move into town like most people, so eventually I just gave her a job as a servant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just to keep her mind busy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, pretty much. Honestly, I think she likes being around the Figments more than being with real people. She certainly wanted nothing to do with tonight&rsquo;s party when I invited her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc stands and walks over to one of the giant windows looking out into the night. The overhead fan in the tea room whirs quietly as he thinks. Finally, he turns around.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna get her to join the party... or at least try to,&rdquo; he says with a grin.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I </span><span class="c1">do</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;think it would be good for her to make some friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agreed. So, how we gonna do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; shall we make a game of it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean whoever convinces her to join&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c7">If</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;we convince her to join.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, right. </span><span class="c1 c7">When</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I convince her to join, I get to be her best friend!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm, Arlene, isn&rsquo;t that for April to decide, not you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, maybe, but I </span><span class="c1 c7">really</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;want to be friends with her. Oh, shhh shhh, here she comes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April reenters the room holding an eyepatch which she hands to Marc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks, April,&rdquo; Marc says as he pulls it over his head. April seems to relax a little when his eye, or lack thereof, is out of sight. &ldquo;That feels loads better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there anything else I can do for either of you?&rdquo; April asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You could join the party!&rdquo; Arlene </span><span class="c1">blurts</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fun! Seriously, it&rsquo;s one of the rules!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No thank you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, maybe later?&rdquo; Arlene tries, grinning uncomfortably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; April responds dryly. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all, I&rsquo;ll be heading back to the servants&rsquo; room.&rdquo; She turns around and exits through the door to the hallway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nice try, Arly,&rdquo; Marc teases. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, guess so,&rdquo; Arlene says, pouting. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t try to smooth talk her. You might scare her away for good. You remember what happened with Gabby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marc flushes red. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; let&rsquo;s not talk about that.&rdquo; And with that he gets up and presses the servant buzzer in the corner.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.vis3kyt2v4r"></a><span class="c6">4</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, April,&rdquo; Marc says into the little microphone. &ldquo;Arly and I were gonna play Uno, would you mind bringing us a deck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speaker: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there momentarily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as if she had been waiting right outside the door, she enters the room with a deck of Uno cards which she places down on the table in the center of the tea room. &ldquo;Will that be all?&rdquo; she asks, already beginning to turn around.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Marc says, &ldquo;Uno is awfully boring with only two people. Since Aidan and Marissa are off on their antidote hunt, we could really use another player.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; April says, nodding. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame. Perhaps one of the Figments would like to play with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Arlene cuts in, &ldquo;we were really hoping that, maybe, you would join us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Afraid not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, well, would you mind bringing us some biscuits to go with this tea?&rdquo; Arlene asks quickly, catching April before she leaves the room. April stops in the doorway, glances at the tables still full of hot food, and sighs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Very well, I will make you some </span><span class="c1 c7">fresh</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;biscuits.&rdquo; She picks up the tray of already made biscuits from one of the tables and exits the grand hall.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Biscuits? Really?&rdquo; Marc says with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It was the best I could think of to keep her around,&rdquo; Arlene says with an awkward smile.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">#</span></p><p class="c3 c4 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kitchen, April shakes her head and takes a bite out of one of the uneaten biscuits. She pulls out some premade biscuit dough from the massive double fridge and begins shaping it into small lumps. Around her, those cookie-cutter, blank-faced Figments run back and forth across the kitchen&mdash;some stuffing trays into the oven or pulling finished meals out, others garnishing colorful dishes with various spices and edible decorations. She tosses one dough ball onto the plate and begins shaping another one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She staggers back, one hand jumping to her heart and breath coming fast as she gawks at an overenthusiastic Arlene. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the food going?&rdquo; Arlene continues. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d visit the kitchen and help you out! </span><span class="c1">Pass me some dough, yo.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; She laughs. &ldquo;Oh my, that sounded far sillier than even I expected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April rolls her eyes, tosses the lump of dough to Arlene, and walks out of the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">#</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marc leans against the wall in the hallway outside the kitchen. &ldquo;I told Arly to leave you be while you were working,&rdquo; he says as April walks out into the hall, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s pretty stubborn someti&mdash; Hey, wait! Where are you going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without responding, April walks past him and turns into the center hallway. Arlene runs out of the kitchen, </span><span class="c1">raw dough still on her hands</span><span class="c1">. She wipes this carelessly on her dress before placing her out turned wrists on her hips and staring down the hall. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Marc, you let her go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She was practically running away after whatever you did in the kitchen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arlene puffs out her cheeks. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"># &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back in the tea room, Marc and Arlene sip at their quickly cooling tea. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do to convince her to join in,&rdquo; Arlene complains. &ldquo;I just know she&rsquo;d have fun if she did, but she&rsquo;s being so stubborn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty stubborn yourself, Arly. You could just let it go, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No way. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, and she&rsquo;s joining this party.&rdquo; She crosses her arms matter-of-factly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not stubborn; I&rsquo;m determined.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc laughs. &ldquo;Whatever you say, </span><span class="c1">lil miss rich and stubborn&mdash;</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&mdash;but I think I&rsquo;ll have a chat with April myself. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to convince her to join us, but I think you&rsquo;re right; it would be good for her to make some friends.&rdquo; With that, he stands up from his seat, gulps down the rest of his tea, and leaves the grand hall. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.9r4jtk4ku3qb"></a><span class="c6">4.5 Halloween Special</span></h3><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1 c8"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://midnightmurderparty.com/interactive/HalloweenSpecial2015&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_fZTEfXli1OdYx1-kpMETdJU8qw">Click here to go trick or treating with Arlene!</a></span><span class="c1">)</span></p><p class="c3 c4 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.awdud4erls7r"></a><span class="c6">5</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the sitting room, Marissa and Aidan sit on one of the pretty, white sofas staring intently down at Arlene&rsquo;s riddle, which is laid out on the table in front of them. Marissa leans back and tugs at her hair with a frustrated growl.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This makes, like, no sense.

He turns his attention to the paper on the table.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">I am the house of many worlds,</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">now mark my words in silence:</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">A two-faced man and lightning&#39;s mark.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Between the faces you will find it.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, look at the last line,&rdquo; Marissa says, pointing. &ldquo;&lsquo;Between the faces you will find it.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s where the flask is, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s gotta be in someone&rsquo;s head. Oh! Maybe we have to blow up Marc&rsquo;s head again!&rdquo; She grins and pulls Marc&rsquo;s eye out of her pocket, flicks it into the air, and snatches it back. Then she raises her hands to her ears, her fingers pressed together in little pincers, one of them dangling the eyeball below her ear. &ldquo;Forget the ring, I&rsquo;m making earrings!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But&hellip; it says &lsquo;two-faced man&rsquo;. That doesn&rsquo;t sound like Marc.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re looking for a man? You&rsquo;re right, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like Marc.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey! He&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Okay, so we need to find a two-faced man and split his head open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yeah? So what&rsquo;s the little stalker boy think then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan winces as she says this and diverts his eyes to the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, c&rsquo;mon, what is it already,&rdquo; she presses, a note of irritation digging into her voice. &ldquo;Maybe you forgot, but we&rsquo;re on a time limit here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-well, what if it&rsquo;s not really a &lsquo;man&rsquo; at all?&rdquo; Aidan finally manages, still not looking up. &ldquo;Like, what if it&rsquo;s something else with faces?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa smirks. &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; well, maybe a dollar bill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be in between a dollar bill, stupid. And there&rsquo;s only one face on those anyway.&rdquo; She pauses and puckers her lips to one side, staring at the last lines of the riddle. &ldquo;What about a mirror? Like, you look into a mirror and there&rsquo;s your face and your face reflected in the mirror. So it&rsquo;s between you and... the mirror?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan scrunches his face. &ldquo;But there are probably lots of mirrors in this house, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa frowns. &ldquo;Yeah, good point. What else has faces, though?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Umm&hellip; what about a clock?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Like the one in the grand hall!&rdquo; Marissa exclaims. Without waiting, she vaults over the back of the sofa and darts towards the grand hall. Aidan glances at the riddle one more time before following her under the arch.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c5 c10"><a name="h.wzrsv3mk5o1z"></a><span class="c6">6</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc strolls down the large hallway, glancing at various busts that rest atop stands in the alcoves as he goes. Most of them look like Arlene. He turns down the hall that extends into the center of the mansion without bothering to look at the floor below him. His foot barely skims over the top of the little silver wire that is stretched across the ground, and, </span><span class="c1">none the wiser, </span><span class="c1">he continues past the door to the theater and turns right into yet another hall which he follows to the end. He stops at a small door with a plaque that reads &ldquo;Servants&rsquo; Quarters&rdquo; and </span><span class="c1">raps</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on the door with his knuckles. After a moment of silence, the door swings back to reveal April.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands half a head shorter than Marc and eyes him warily, but not impolitely, with her cool, grey eyes. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there something you&rsquo;d like?&rdquo; she asks in her mild tone. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to come over here yourself, you know. You could have just used the buzzer.&rdquo; She gestures at a small box on the wall of the servants&rsquo; room.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I figured I&rsquo;d save you the trouble,&rdquo; Marc says, peering into the room as if he&rsquo;d never seen it before. His eyes catch on a game of Solitaire sprawled out on a table. &ldquo;You like card games?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glances back at her game. &ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Solitaire, right? My brother and I used to play that together when we were little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Together?&rdquo; she says, eyebrows raised.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc laughs. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess playing something that&rsquo;s practically named &lsquo;solitary&rsquo; with another person kinda defeats the purpose.&rdquo; He pauses, looking thoughtfully at the cards. &ldquo;But we had fun. Had our own set of rules and everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not weird. House rules. Hey, how &lsquo;bout I show you how we used to play?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather just finish my own game,&rdquo; she says, half closing the the door before Marc can speak again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Woah, wait a sec,&rdquo; Marc exclaims, pulling his hand away from the closing door. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Would you mind if I came in? I never did learn to play with the real rules.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks at him doubtfully for a moment and then sighs. &ldquo;Fine. But leave the door open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They move to the couch in the servants&rsquo; room. On one side of the room, there are big windows that, during just the right time of day, may cast golden afternoon light across the creamy white carpet that matches the couches. On the other is a folded wooden screen behind which servants could change for work. Though, from the barren look of that corner, Figments needn&rsquo;t use changing rooms too often.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">April studies the cards</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on the table, </span><span class="c1">plucks out a Four of Hearts and places it down on a Five of Clubs</span><span class="c1">. &ldquo;You have to alternate the colors,&rdquo; she says, not looking up at Marc. &ldquo;You want to get a full stack, King all the way down to Two, if possible.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happens when you finish the stack?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing, it just stays there. The stacks are just intermediary. You really want to build the Foundations.&rdquo; She points at the top right of the game board where three Aces are lined up, some with cards on top of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t sound too hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks up at him with an expression that seems to say &ldquo;oh yeah?&rdquo; and instead says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder than it looks. What would your next move be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc stares at the available cards for a moment before saying, &ldquo;Just move that Queen onto that King.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t. Wrong color.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, right. Umm&hellip; in that case&hellip;&rdquo; He goes back to perusing the cards, his eyes darting from one card to the bottom of the next stack followed by a subtle head-shake and more studying. &ldquo;What do you do if you get stuck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc catches a little smirk on April&rsquo;s face, and as soon as he sees, it flashes away. &ldquo;In that case, you have to move more cards into the Waste&mdash;to see if there are any more moves you can make.&rdquo; She pulls more cards from the deck and frowns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any useful cards,&rdquo; Marc says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She cycles the deck again. Still nothing. Again a few more times before she leans back and sighs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; Marc asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A losing hand. Not as easy as it looks, huh?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously? We lost?&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s kinda disappointing. So what now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She casts him a quick glance, gathers the cards together into a neat deck, shuffles them a few times, and begins laying the cards out again for a new round.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You play this a lot?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April nods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jeez, don&rsquo;t you ever get bored?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she says, laying another card down, &ldquo;but it passes the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seems like a lonely game,&rdquo; Marc says. &ldquo;I think I like my version better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To this, April only shrugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you know any games we can play together?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blackjack, poker, rummy&hellip;&rdquo; She casts him a wry, little grin. &ldquo;Uno.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about we play one of those,&rdquo; Marc offers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April nods at the seat across the table from them, and Marc moves to the new seat. She scoops all the cards up from her unfinished game into a rough pile, straightens it, shuffles again, and begins dealing a hand of Blackjack. &ldquo;Got anything to bet?&rdquo; she asks as she places the last card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only my soul,&rdquo; Marc jokes, attempting to turn out his empty pockets while seated, struggling with the chore for a moment, and finally pulling </span><span class="c1">one</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pocket out in a clunky motion. A giggle slips out of April&rsquo;s mouth before her cupped hand snaps to her face to hold the laugh back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That was funny.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marc, whose face is now a little flushed, waves it off. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Oh, I&rsquo;ve got an idea for a bet. Do you have any poker chips?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April quietly gets up and walks to the closet in the back of the room where she rummages around for a minute before pulling out a poker set.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know how poker chips work,&rdquo; Marc says, &ldquo;but ten chips each should be fine. Let&rsquo;s just say color doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nods and deals them both ten chips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So how about this,&rdquo; Marc continues. &ldquo;Whoever ends up with all the chips wins. If I win, you join the party with the rest of us. And if you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marc falls silent, his mouth hanging where his last word had ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to join the party. I&rsquo;ve said it before, and I would appreciate it if you and Arlene would stop asking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room stays quiet, save for the sound of their breathing, as Marc searches for something to say. Finally, he settles on: &ldquo;Okay, I get it. Then let&rsquo;s try this instead. If </span><span class="c1 c7">you</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;win, we&rsquo;ll all leave you alone. We won&rsquo;t ask you to join in again if you don&rsquo;t want to. But if </span><span class="c1 c7">I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;win, you join only for the next story. You don&rsquo;t have to speak to us, you don&rsquo;t have to participate in the actual game, and you can leave whenever you like, including during the story if you are really having a terrible time. Does that sound fair?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again the room falls quiet as April looks from Marc to the card game laid out on the table. She furrows her brow as she thinks, and Marc leans back, patiently awaiting her response. Then, she puts one finger on a poker piece, nudges it into the center of the table and says, &ldquo;Ante up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.1xx21ss2ujxc"></a><span class="c6">7</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, kid. Help me push this stupid clock off the wall,&rdquo; Marissa says, heaving all her weight into the grandfather clock. Aidan pushes harder, but it doesn&rsquo;t budge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my, what on Earth are you two up to?&rdquo; Arlene asks, gliding across the grand hall to where Aidan and Marissa stand with beads of sweat forming along their brows.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Trying&hellip; to find&hellip; the antidote,&rdquo; Marissa grunts between shoves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ahh, yes, and I suppose you found my clue?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Aidan responds, easing off the clock. &ldquo;We think that, maybe, the clock has two faces&mdash;one on the front and one on the back, only the back one&rsquo;s hidden. Two faces, like in the riddle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t stop pushing!&rdquo; Marissa grumbles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah! Sorry!&rdquo; Aidan says, leaning into the clock again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arlene laughs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about her, Aidan. She&rsquo;s grouchy with everybody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nuh-uh! Only with people who </span><span class="c18">cre</span><span class="c12">ep</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">m</span><span class="c16">e</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;o-</span><span class="c1">...&rdquo; Marissa&rsquo;s sentence trails off abruptly, and she sways on her feet. One hand latches onto the wall for support, and the other grabs her head. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Aidan asks with innocent urgency. Arlene laughs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It looks like it&rsquo;s starting to kick in,&rdquo; she says, casting them a devilish smile. &ldquo;Better figure out that riddle quickly.&rdquo; She makes for the archway.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Aidan calls. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just going to catch up on some reading while I wait for your brother to return. He sure is taking his time. I even went tricking or treating while I was waiting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, okay,&rdquo; Aidan says, looking a little puzzled.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Arlene adds as she heads for the arch, &ldquo;that clock only has one face.&rdquo; She leaves the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan peeks around the clock at Marissa, who has regained her balance and is now leaning against the clock with her forehead pressed into her palm and her hair falling down around her face in auburn streaks. &ldquo;Hey, uh, are you alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; she growls, straightening up and trying to blink the bleariness out of her eyes. &ldquo;Relax, I just got kinda dizzy. She said it&rsquo;s not this clock, right? Maybe there&rsquo;s another clock around here somewhere.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got a problem, kid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been thinking...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About the riddle. We kinda skipped over the first couple lines.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Could we, maybe, go back to it?&rdquo; He looks at Marissa hopefully and then rushes to add, &ldquo;You know, only if you want to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine, whatever, not that the stupid riddle&rsquo;s gonna do us any good.&rdquo; She closes her eyes and massages her temple with the heel of her palm. When she opens them again, </span><span class="c1">that piercing, green sharpness </span><span class="c1">has returned to her glare. &ldquo;What are you waiting for? Hurry it up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They leave the grand hall and head back to the sitting room where they read over the riddle again. Aidan&rsquo;s eyes skim over the words a couple times. On the third pass, they light up so that the timidness in his face nearly vanishes completely, replaced by excitement and realization. He snatches up the paper and folds it in three places so that the creases separate certain lines of the riddle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The hell you doing?&rdquo; Marissa says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to read that, you know.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan flinches at her outburst, but doesn&rsquo;t pause. &ldquo;Look at the punctuation,&rdquo; he says, spreading the paper on the table before them again. The riddle now reads:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">I am the house of many worlds,</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">now mark my words in silence:</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">A two-faced man and lightning&#39;s mark.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Between the faces you will find it.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Marissa says, sounding both bored and annoyed, but moreso the latter. &ldquo;You folded the paper. So what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The punctuation, doesn&rsquo;t it seem to separate different thoughts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa stares at the page again, frowning. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; she finally says, not sounding at all convinced. &ldquo;So, you wanna take it from the beginning or something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa shrugs resignedly. &ldquo;Alright, fine. &lsquo;I am the house of many worlds&rsquo;,&rdquo; she reads, &ldquo;whatever </span><span class="c1 c7">that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;means.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan doesn&rsquo;t respond right away. He stares at the first line for a moment before speaking. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s talking about a place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, duh. It </span><span class="c1 c7">is </span><span class="c1">supposed to lead us to the flask, which is, ya know, </span><span class="c1 c7">in a place</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s if</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;this is even a real clue. I bet Arlene&rsquo;s just distracting us with this dumb puzzle while we slowly die from poison. Hey, are you even listening to me, kid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidan hushes her, still staring at the riddle. Marissa glares at him, clearly taken aback, but he doesn&rsquo;t notice. Instead, he runs his finger across the first line again and mutters, &ldquo;&lsquo;House of many worlds&rsquo;... Maybe it&rsquo;s a big place with other places inside it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? Like a state?&rdquo; Marissa </span><span class="c1">suggests.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, like that!&rdquo; He pauses, gnawing on his index finger. &ldquo;Except a state doesn&rsquo;t really feel like a &lsquo;world&rsquo;. But what else has places?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dunno, a map, a universe, a, uh, I dunno, country, maybe a&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan gasps, and Marissa lets out an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;Yeah? What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A universe!&rdquo; Aidan says. &ldquo;That might be it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh? Isn&rsquo;t that too big?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh-huh, but what if it&rsquo;s like the Marvel Universe? With superheroes and supervillains and stuff?&rdquo; His face is glowing with excitement. &ldquo;Arlene has a theater. I saw it earlier. So she&rsquo;s gotta have a collection of movies somewhere. If we think of each movie as its own universe, or world like it says in the riddle&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We could call the theater the &lsquo;house of many worlds,&rsquo;&rdquo; Marissa fills in, her eyes growing wide. &ldquo;Huh, maybe you&rsquo;re useful for something after all.&rdquo; She snatches the riddle, hops over the back of the couch, and runs for the theater.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-hey! Wait for me!&rdquo; Aidan calls after her.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1">#</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa bounds around the corner into the center hall and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;hops nimbly over the tripwire, yelling &ldquo;Woah, nice one, Arlene!&rdquo; as she jumps. Aidan comes around the corner soon after, more careful in avoiding the wire as he follows her into the theater. He climbs up the stairs along the side and into the raised back of the room where Marissa is waiting. Here, there is a plain-looking door that blends in so seamlessly with the walls that Aidan wouldn&rsquo;t have n</span><span class="c1">oticed it if Marissa hadn&rsquo;t roughly grabbed his shoulder and shoved him towards it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; she states, taking a couple steps back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Marissa says plainly, &ldquo;if Arlene really hid the antidote in there, then that door is defs booby-trapped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; Aidan shifts away from the door. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; maybe you should open it?&rdquo; he suggests hopefully. &ldquo;You seem really good with her traps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, is the little creeper scared? If I had known all I had to do to get you to stop following me was to go through a door, I would have done that ages ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not scared,&rdquo; Aidan mutters, pouting. A note of petulant stubbornness sneaks into his voice. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not a creeper. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo; He breaks off and looks away, a pink heat rising in his cheeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what? </span><span class="c1 c7">Huh?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing. Back up, I&rsquo;ll open the stupid door.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He grabs the handle and yanks it open. There is a sharp click as he pulls, and he winces. </span><span class="c1 c7">Boing</span><span class="c1">. A spring pops, and Aidan yells, stumbling backwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? What is it?&rdquo; Marissa exclaims, also wheeling back away from the door, wide-eyed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan grabs a seat to steady himself as he stares into the open door. His breath comes in big, gasping sighs and slowly eases back into a normal rhythm. Once his breathing is coming normally again, another unexpected sound escapes his lips: a small snicker. This is followed by another one, a little louder this time, and in a moment he is doubled over laughing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; Marissa shouts as she attempts to peer past Aidan into the room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;L-look for y-yourself,&rdquo; Aidan manages between giggles. Marissa closes the distance between her and the door and looks inside. Then, she is laughing too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good one, Arlene!&rdquo; She shouts toward the theater door as if Arlene can hear her. Then, to Aidan: &ldquo;I told you Arlene&rsquo;s traps are the best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aidan nods in agreement, wiping the laughing-tears away from his eyes. Inside the door, atop a spring and still bobbing back and forth like a drunkard, is a</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;jack-in-the-box</span><span class="c1">. The face is painted white with comic dots of red on each cheek and a silly tongue lolling out of its open mouth. Drawn onto its forehead between tufts of orange, plastic hair is the word &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Gotcha!</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s check inside,&rdquo; Marissa says once they&rsquo;ve managed to get a hold of themselves again. Aidan follows her in with a nod, and they both begin digging around the small room. On the same side as the door, a projector juts towards the big theater screen. It rests atop a thick wooden desk with a couple drawers. Aidan pulls these open but finds nothing other than some old electrical equipment and a couple broken reels of film that don&rsquo;t even seem to belong with the projector. He pops these open just in case, but there is nothing inside. Wired into the projector is a </span><span class="c1">small DVD player</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which proves to be equally empty. Marissa searches the cabinets on the other side of the room, but comes up with the same results.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in here,&rdquo; she groans. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not even a single movie in this room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where does Arlene usually keep movies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How should I know? Wouldn&rsquo;t you keep them in the theater? What&rsquo;s that stupid riddle say anyway?&rdquo; She pulls the crumpled riddle out of her pocket and reads the first segment aloud. &ldquo;I am the house of many worlds, now mark my words in silence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now mark my words in silence,&rdquo; Aidan repeats under his breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That important or something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh&hellip; well, you&rsquo;re supposed to be quiet in a theater, but still&hellip; I feel like we missed something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And what might that be, Detective Creepy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My brother and I used to like doing riddles before&mdash;&rdquo; He cuts off abruptly, glancing at Marissa for a moment before seeming satisfied that she hadn&rsquo;t noticed. Her eyes have become bleary again, and she shakes her head to refocus. &ldquo;We used to like doing riddles,&rdquo; Aidan continues, &ldquo;and he told me once that the key is to focus on the words. Every detail is important.&rdquo; He pauses for a moment. &ldquo;Words. And mark my </span><span class="c1 c7">words</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in silence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Marissa says, resting her weight against the wall, one hand on her head, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c7">that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Aidan says, &ldquo;that means we&rsquo;re in the wrong place. Arlene said she was going to catch up on some reading, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, where does she keep her books?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">The library. Duh</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I kinda got really caught up on the movie idea because I saw the theater before, but a library can be considered a house of many worlds too! And, it says &lsquo;mark my words in silence.&rsquo; Where do you find words?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In a book?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah! That&rsquo;s what makes it different from a theater. We&rsquo;re looking for a book in the library.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marissa wavers on her feet and grasps the desk with the projector on it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry. I don&rsquo;t&hellip; feel so good.&rdquo; She leads Aidan to the library, occasionally groping for the wall to regain her balance. Once, her legs wobble and give out, and Aidan attempts to help her up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quit touchin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she says weakly, shrugging him off. She claps her hands over her head, shakes herself, and manages to regain her feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They enter the library.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c3 c10 c5"><a name="h.cpeowdjv6hoo"></a><span class="c6">8</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Aww, again?&rdquo; Marc whines as April scoops the small pile of poker chips from the center of the table into her own stack. Marc tosses his cards towards April who slides them back into the deck and begins a well-practiced shuffle. A large pile of chips lies in front of her, neatly stacked in fives. On Marc&rsquo;s side, there are only four chips, laid out sadly as if they had fallen from April&rsquo;s stash by accident. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m not too good at this game after all. I always was a bigger fan of Uno. Still,&rdquo; he says grinning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about this next hand.&rdquo; He nudges two of his last chips into the center and leans back as April matches his bet and deals the cards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picks up his cards and studies them. Eight and Two. &ldquo;Double down.&rdquo; He slides his last two chips into the pool, and April regards him with a dull expression.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure? You&rsquo;ve just gone all in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I told you, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about this hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You said that about the last eight,&rdquo; she says, tossing two of her chips into the center and sliding him another card. She takes another for herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, but I mean it this time. Ready?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both flip up their cards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc: &ldquo;21&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April: &ldquo;20&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc laughs. &ldquo;Woah, that was too close! I had a ten, so I doubled down, but that was one lucky ace, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Very lucky.&rdquo; April tosses two more chips into the pot. &ldquo;Nice blackjack,&rdquo; she says a little sourly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, now you gotta watch out cuz I&rsquo;m back in the game!&rdquo; He pulls the ten chips in the center over to his side. His pile, although messy, is now the same size as April&rsquo;s. She deals another hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, April,&rdquo; Marc begins, picking up his cards and giving them a distracted glance. They don&rsquo;t seem to hold much interest now that he&rsquo;s not down to his last chips. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to answer this, I won&rsquo;t press it or anything, but why don&rsquo;t you wanna join the party?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April looks up from her cards mildly. In a furtive voice: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to answer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s fine. Hit, by the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tosses him another card, looks at her own hand again, and then asks him if he&rsquo;d like to hit or stay. He stays, and they both reveal their cards.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bust,&rdquo; Marc says and raises his palms to the air in a what-can-you-do gesture. April takes the pot and flicks four more cards out in front of them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How long have you been staying with Arlene?&rdquo; Marc asks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April just shrugs. &ldquo;A while, I guess. Time&rsquo;s strange here.&rdquo; She casts a somewhat hesitant glance at the clock in the corner, notices it still reads midnight, and shudders.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Still weirds you out? Guess you haven&rsquo;t been around for too long after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Guess not. What would you like to do by the way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, uh, stay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both flip up their cards again, and April sweeps the pot into her own pile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jeez, I think I used up all my luck on that double down,&rdquo; Marc says. &ldquo;I only seem to get lucky when I bet a lot. Ya bet big, ya win big, right?&rdquo; He pushes his eight remaining chips into the pot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April raises her stolid gaze to meet his eyes. &ldquo;You bet big, you fall hard.&rdquo; She grins ruefully and deals the next hand. Marc picks it up and frowns. </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that lucky hand?&rdquo; she</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;teases, already reading on his face that the hand was anything but lucky. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s great. Hit me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She begins to deal a card, and Marc cuts her off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I mean seriously hit me. Right here.&rdquo; He gestures at his cheek. &ldquo;For betting that much on this terrible hand.&rdquo; Marc flinches when she actually reaches across the table, punches him lightly on the shoulder, and laughs into her still curled up fist.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to be careful what you bet, Marc,&rdquo; she says with a more serious tone. &ldquo;I learned that the hard way.&rdquo; Marc seems about to inquire further when she continues. &ldquo;You asked why I don&rsquo;t want to join the party. Let&rsquo;s just say that I bet on the wrong crowd once, and I don&rsquo;t intend to do it again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc regards her, a little more seriously himself, for a moment. &ldquo;Sorry to hear it, but we&rsquo;re an alright crowd, if that means anything to you. In fact, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;ve got a pretty awesome crowd. But I won&rsquo;t push the issue.&rdquo; He looks at his cards again, clicks his tongue with distaste, and flips them for April to see. &ldquo;Doubt I can push the issue with this hand anyway. Sixteen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">April flips hers over as well. &ldquo;Guess not. Nineteen.&rdquo; She adds the pot to her pile, not looking up. Marc stands up and stretches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d better get back to the party then and let Arlene know I&rsquo;ve gambled away whatever ridiculous invitation she may have been planning for you.&rdquo; He chuckles at the thought and heads for the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been fun playing with you. Maybe I&rsquo;ll stop by here again if you don&rsquo;t mind the company.&rdquo; He pauses, giving her a moment to respond. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she says, smiling softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great! Well, in that case, I&rsquo;ll see you later tonight. Feel free to join the party if you change your mind by the way.
